Set up an development-webserver use the following commands:

aptitude install git
git clone git://github.com/SimonSimCity/webserver-configuration.git
cd webserver-configuration

Out of here you can use all the scripts that are avaiable in this package.
I prefer to use the install.sh to run all the scripts.
