This script is a basic script to create a webdevelopment-webserver I run.
The steps you have to do before you can use this script is just setting up
a clean Linux Debian Squeeze environment (or something simular).

At first update your apt-configuration that you can also install contributed
and non-free software like the fastcgi-extension for apache2.

Set up an development-webserver use the following commands:

aptitude install git
git clone git://github.com/SimonSimCity/webserver-configuration.git
chmod +x webserver-configuration -R
cd webserver-configuration

Out of here you can use all the scripts that are avaiable in this package.
I prefer to use the install.sh to run all the scripts.
